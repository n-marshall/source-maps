Various Materials 1.0 ©the_best_flash 2007 

These free textures came from GC Textures at http://www.cgtextures.com/ and were edited and compiled by me, the_best_flash.
Therefore they cannot be used for any commerical project without the consent of the aforementioned http://www.cgtextures.com/.
(Projects that will be free are OK though :-D)

You can use these in any project that will be free... Just inlude something about the GC Textures website and give credit to the_best_flash somewhere (I don't care where, just as long as it's somewhere, even in small print. It took a lot of time to bumpmap and crop all these so they look nice.)

This contains 198 different high-quality bumpmapped materials... So you should be able to find something you like...
73 of these are blends... The rest are materials... (And as I said before they are all high quality and bumpmapped.)
If you do not like the fact that they are bumpmapped or think this makes them look terrible just add '//' before the $bumpmap command in the .VMF file.

This contains various materials from such categories as: Asphalt, Brick, Carpet, Concrete, Dirt, Earth, Fabric, Grass, Rocks, Roofs, Sand, Tile, and Wood.


SO, enjoy...
